# DBM - Vanilla and Season of Discovery

## [r763](https://github.com/DeadlyBossMods/DBM-Vanilla/tree/r763) (2024-12-04)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/DeadlyBossMods/DBM-Vanilla/compare/r762...r763) [Previous Releases](https://github.com/DeadlyBossMods/DBM-Vanilla/releases)

- BWL/Broodlord: Add warning for Tactical Charge target  
    Season of Mastery stuff that I missed earlier.  
- Add a "block" for Gtfo warnings  
    Blocks are a new experimental thing to reduce repetitive code for recurring patterns in mods. I'll be using the Geddon mod as a first example as it has two common patterns: Gtfo warnings and bombs on players.  
    As a side-effect this fixes a bug about a Gtfo warning not working properly in SoD  
- Push trash timer stop tweak
