[Full Changelog](https://github.com/DeadlyBossMods/DBM-Vanilla/compare/r766...r767) [Previous Releases](https://github.com/DeadlyBossMods/DBM-Vanilla/releases)

- Bug Trio: Keep GTFO warning around after fight ends as the pool persists  
- Prophet Skeram: Interrupt warning and minor tweak for Mind Control on SoD  
    SoD mind control only targets one player, no point in waiting 0.5 seconds  
- Fankriss: Add AntiSpam for worm summon warning  
- AQ40 Trash: Add pretty much the same warnings as we have for AQ20
