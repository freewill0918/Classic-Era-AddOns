# [5.19.6](https://github.com/WeakAuras/WeakAuras2/tree/5.19.6) (2025-04-02)

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/WeakAuras/WeakAuras2/compare/5.19.5...5.19.6)

## Highlights

Fixes:

- Bug report url points to the correct issue template now.
- model subregions were punished & will now obey the rotation option.
- Fixed Bigwigs trigger following an update of that addon. (thanks @ntowle!)
- Fixed misc errors with fallback states (i.e. when options are open).
- Fixed some templates which were producing nonsense auras.
- Localization should have fewer duplicate phrases for our translators to work through.
- Fixed an oversight with how progress works for sub-elements attached to an empty region.
- The sliders on stop motion animation start/end properties should now behave as sliders, not just weird looking inputs.
- Fixed spell cache to account for some insane choices blizzard made.
- Ticks now correctly update their location when progress source is changed via conditions.
- String-valued properties can now be correctly "unset" via conditions without having to do arcane workarounds.
- A progress source from an inactive trigger no longer does insane things.
- Faction reputation trigger no longer gives a mangled %standing string for renown-style factions.

New Features:

- There's a new "Since Active" condition variable, which allows for temporary property changes when a trigger activates.
- Pending updates to installed auras have a context menu to help make it less frustrating if you want to do anything other than accept the update.
- Load has a new player guild option, works similarly to player name.
- Health trigger absorb & heal absorb overlays now support "Attach to End, backwards" mode.
- Several formatters learned how to pad strings with spaces on the left or right sides. WeakAuras.PadString(string, mode, length) is also available in custom code to perform the same task.
- Item Equipped trigger & load option learned how to do exact match on the item id.
